<p>His creative style is characterized by the blending of diverse world music genres with jazz, including jota, bulería, rumba, pateado, giga, medieval cantigas, Venezuelan waltz, modinha waltz, Brazilian choros, Afro‑pandeirada, alalá‑blues, raga, etc., resulting in a sound framed within the Iberian World‑Jazz movement. His recorded works, marked by a strong programmatic line, roots in classical guitar, in‑depth jazz research and direct ties to traditional and popular music, make him a musician with a voice of his own, recognized by RNE’s specialist critics as the pioneer of “Muiñeira‑Jazz”.</p>

<p>He began his musical studies at the Conservatorio de Ourense – Spain, where he graduated in classical guitar under the tutelage of maestro Tomás Camacho and soon performed in concerts organized by Asociación Guitarrística Galega de Vigo between 1978 and 1980.</p>
<p>He attended the historic Jazz Seminars in Banyoles – Girona (1980–81), organized by Taller de Músics, with renowned American masters such as Thad Jones, Chuck Israels, Hal Crook, Steve Brown, Jim McNeely, Ben Riley, Bill Dobbins, Sal Nistico and Claudio Roditi; musicians who introduced him to the world of jazz and taught him its true philosophy.</p>
<p>In 1981 he studied at Taller de Músics in Barcelona with Mario Lecaros and taught classical guitar at that school.</p>
<p>A few months later he moved to California – USA to study harmony, improvisation and arrangements with American trombonist and teacher Hal Crook, from whom he received the recognition and methodology to found in 1983 the Baio Ensamble in Vigo – Spain, acknowledged as the first jazz school in Galicia.</p>
<p><a href="/images/biografia/821024%e2%80%91HalCrook1.jpg" >Hal Crook recommendation letter – 1982</a></p>
<p>Between 1982 and 1984 he formed a guitar duo with Elías Quiroga and the Baio Quartet with guitarist Cuchus Pimentel, performing at various festivals, notably those organized by Xuventudes Musicais de Vigo.</p>
<p>From 1985 onward, he devoted himself to studying piano, which became the instrument defining his future professional career. Between 1985 and 1986 he focused on activities linked to the Escuela Baio Ensamble. That same year he participated in the I Jazz Seminar of Galicia in Poio – Pontevedra, organized by Taller de Músics de Madrid and directed by American guitarist Steve Brown, attending classes with Bill Dobbins and Steve Brown.</p>
<p>From 1987 to 1990 he was employed to teach jazz at the Conservatorio de Santiago de Compostela, alternating teaching with performances and recordings with the group Noroeste, while acting as musical director and arranger of Orquesta Los Satélites de A Coruña.</p>
<p>In 1990 he resumed the Escuela Baio Ensamble, combining teaching with jazz performance, offering concerts, jam sessions and recordings.</p>
<p>In 1993 he resumed his studies in classical and Baroque harmony with maestro Pablo Beltrán, coinciding with a commission from Galician harpist and singer Emilio Cao, for whom he adapted music for the Orquesta Clásica de Madrid as part of the Xacobeo 93 program.</p>
<p>Between 1996 and 2000 he recorded two pioneering albums blending Galician popular music, jazz and symphonic music, from which the term “Muiñeira Jazz” was coined by Ramón Trecet, director of RNE’s Diálogos 3.</p>
<p>This project preluded the creation of the Alberto Conde Trio with bassist Baldo Martínez and percussionist Nirankhar Khalsa, with whom he worked for the next seven years, producing and recording two new albums for Nuba – Karonte Records and participating in the internationally successful album <em>Flamenco Jazz</em>.</p>
<p>In 2002 he premiered his opera‑prima <em>Sonidos de Bitácora</em>.</p>
<p>In 2007 he won the position of jazz piano professor at the Conservatorio Superior de Música de A Coruña, in which he currently practices this specialty.</p>
<p>In 2009 the American guitarist Steve Brown invited him to collaborate on the production and recording of a new sextet album titled <em>Atlantic Bridge</em>, recorded in New York and released by Karonte (Spain) and Brown Cats (USA). Simultaneously, under Steve Brown’s direction, he taught master classes and workshops at Ithaca College and Cornell University in New York.</p>
<p>In 2012 he produced and recorded a new album titled <em>Villa‑Lobos a new way</em> with soprano Carmen Durán and the Atlantic Trio (the core of Atlantic Bridge: bassist Kin García, drummer Miguel Cabana and Alberto Conde), using texts by poet‑musicologist JR Bustamante, adapting Villa‑Lobos to jazz from a classical aesthetic. The album was released in 2013 by Karonte Records, sponsored by Xunta de Galicia.</p>
<p>In 2014 he produced, recorded and premiered at the X Festival Imaxina Sons in Vigo a new project titled <em>Human Evolution Music Project</em>, a concept album exploring human evolution through a fusion of Iberian jazz and Indian classical music, pioneering interactive dialogue between piano and sitar. The album was released by Jazz Records in Coimbra – Portugal.</p>

The album was released in 2019 by Clean Feed under the title <em>The Wake of an Artist – Tribute to Bernardo Sassetti</em>, presented at the Hot Clube de Lisboa, Encontros Internacionais de Jazz de Coimbra 2019, and Fundação Camões in Vigo.</p>

The work was premiered under the direction of Alberto Conde himself on 6/6/2021 at the Teatro Colón in A Coruña, sponsored by the City Council and the Provincial Council of A Coruña, and with the collaboration of the Department of Linguistic Normalization of the Xunta of Galicia.</p>
<p>In 2020, he premiered the commissioned work titled &ldquo;Federico García Lorca, a journey of the soul, a current&rdquo;, from the García Lorca Foundation, based on texts by the universal poet from Granada. The work was performed and broadcast live from the Federico García Lorca Park in Alfacar – Granada on 18/8/2020 to commemorate the 84th tribute to the poet and all the victims of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>In 2021 he produced with bassist/composer Kin García the album <em>Portus Apostoli</em> by the Atlantic Bridge Jazz Project, sponsored by Concello de Noia and Xunta de Galicia, presenting it at the 44th Jazz Festival of Vitoria‑Gasteiz.</p>
<p>In 2022 he presented <em>Portus Apostoli</em> with the Atlantic Bridge Jazz Project at the II Festival Jazz‑Class de Vigo, organized and sponsored by Vitruvia Café and Concello de Vigo.</p>
<p>In 2023, the Nuba/Karonte label released the double album Corriente del Golfo, which was performed live with a 10-piece band at the Praza da Quintana in Santiago de Compostela. The performance was recorded by Casa de Tolos for RTVG and is available to the public on their agalega.gal channel in the &ldquo;Palco&rdquo; section.</p>
<p>That same year, the project was presented at the Estrella de Galicia Festival in A Coruña with a nonet, and also at the Casa de Galicia in Madrid and to national and Madrid-based media outlets, in a duo format with singer Diana Tarín.</p>
<p>In 2024, the work was performed again with a 10-piece band in the city of Vigo as part of the Musicav Festival, organized by Vitruvia Café with sponsorship from the Xunta de Galicia.</p>
<p>That same year, a new album was released with American guitarist John Stowell and the Atlantic Bridge Trio, featuring bassist Kin Garcia, drummer Miguel Cabana, and Alberto Conde himself on piano.</p>
